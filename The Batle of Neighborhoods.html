# The Batle of Neighborhoods (Draft)

## Introduction / Business Problem

Foreigners in adjacent Cities (Dhahran and Manama)  in Saudia Arabia & Bharain travel a lot for business purpose and as well as during the weekend. They always look for best quality foods restaurants, shopping stores  and coffee shops. It would be helpful for them to have single and easy interface to look around different venues their ratings, how many are check-ins at anytime etc.

Using the data provided by the Foursquare API of both cities (Dhahran & Manama) a simple & elegant store locator API can be built with customization of local data as well user preferences.

Objective of this study is to visualize the venues and associated details on the map.
